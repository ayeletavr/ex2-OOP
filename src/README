SpaceShip.java - This class represents a spaceship object in the game.
this is a father class to all kinds of spaceships in the game.
SpaceShipFactory.java - This class represents the physical state of spaceship.
a.java - the aggressive spaceship class.
b.java - the basher spaceship class.
d.java - the drunkard spaceship class.
h.java - the human-controlled spaceship class.
r.java - the runner spaceship class.
s.java - the special spaceship class.

=============================
In this exercise, we were requested to design a SpaceWars game, with different kinds of spaceships.
Since all kinds of them are actually Ships, I chose to make SpaceShip class abstract,
and try to implement as many methods in this class.
Spaceship is a father class to all kinds of ships (a, b, d, h, s, d),
and some of spaceships methods were implemented inside those classes.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
As I wrote by explaining the project design -
When a method should be implement the same to all kinds of spaceships, it was implemented in SpaceShip class.
When a method should be implement to a specific kind of spaceship, it was implemented in the specific class.
